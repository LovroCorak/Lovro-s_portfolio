# Lovro's webscraper file 
This project implements a web scraping script designed to extract contact information, specifically phone numbers and logo URLs, from websites.  The script is written in Python and leverages the requests library for fetching website content and BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML structure.  Regular expressions are employed for robust phone number identification, accommodating various formats.  The script iterates through user-provided URLs, extracting the desired information and printing it to the console.  Error handling is incorporated to gracefully manage potential issues such as website unavailability or unexpected HTML structures.  The code prioritizes efficiency by first searching for phone numbers in \<a\> tags with "tel:", "fax:", or "phone:" prefixes before exploring other tags.  Similarly, logo identification prioritizes \<img\> tags with "logo" in the alt or class attributes, followed by a search within the \<header\> tag. This approach balances accuracy and performance. This script provides a foundation for automated contact information gathering and can be further extended to include additional data points or integrated into larger data processing pipelines.
  
# Lovro robotics simulator
This Python script simulates and controls a Franka Panda robot arm using PyBullet. It loads the robot and a plane, sets up a basic simulation environment with gravity, and then commands the robot's joints to move to predefined target positions. The script uses position control to drive the joints. It also includes a camera that tracks the robot's base. Key elements include loading URDF models, setting joint target positions, stepping the simulation, and camera control. The code is designed for basic robot arm manipulation within the PyBullet environment. Joint control is currently limited to the first four joints, and target positions should be tuned for specific movements. Gains for motor control have not been implemented, which would improve the realism of the simulation.
